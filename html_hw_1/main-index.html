                    <p class="brotalk">Health and fitness has always been a hobby and lifestyle of mine. Ever since middle school,
                        physical excersize and nutrition has had my intrest. Since I have always nerded out about all things sports science,
                        I went to school to become a physical tharapist. I discontinued that effort after understanding the 
                        realities of becoming a PT. 
                        At this point, excersize is more of a release and a self-care regiment which I do almost daily.

                    <p class="brotalk"> I love to always be learning somthing new. While searching 
                        for a career I formally studied criminal justice, physical therapy, physiology, mortgage lending,
                        and now software engineering. During my down time, I often have podcasts of various topics
                        playing in the background. I do this because 
                        I thoroughly enjoy insightful conversation. I find learning very 
                        rewarding and I'd probably attend college just ofr the sake of it if it were free.

                        All my time that I have outside of work and study I give to my family. Spending quality time and being there for
                        family is the greatest use of ones time. On the weekends you will find me at the lake with my 
                        girlfriend Jessica and my dog Kingsley.

                                I applied here on a whim and have remained employeed here for seven years. I began 
                                as an entry-level busser and worked my way up to a senior managment position. My time here has 
                                tought me much more than I can summerise. Although hospitality is not my dream career, my time
                                here at Immersion has been time well spent.

                <p>I am attending Coding Temple so I can begin a career in software engineering. I was never a tech-savy person, nor did I have much intrest in technology.
                    Infact, I touted to my friends how little time I spent on computers, video games, or other devices. My brother, who is a software engineer, persistantly 
                    told me to consider software engineering since he knew I have been struggling to find my ideal career after I graduated college. Finally, my brother wore me down and 
                    convinced me to take an online course from a website called Udemy. The course was about HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and I became hooked imediatly. After several months
                    of study, I reduced my hours at the brewery to part time and am now attending Coding Temple. 
                    I am eager to progress in the trade and thrilled to see where it can take me.
